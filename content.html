<p>When a program runs, things don't always go as planned. A user might enter invalid data, a file might not exist, or a calculation might try to divide by zero. Some programming languages use <strong>exceptions</strong> as a structured way to report these unexpected situations.</p>

<h2>What is an Exception?</h2>

<p>An <strong>exception</strong> is a signal that something has gone wrong during program execution. Instead of simply crashing or returning an error code, a program can use exceptions to indicate that an error occurred and halt the normal flow of execution. The exception carries information about what went wrong, including the type of error and where it occurred.</p>

<p>Common examples of situations that trigger exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Division by zero:</strong> Attempting to divide a number by zero</li>
<li><strong>Index out of range:</strong> Trying to access an element at a position that doesn't exist in a list</li>
<li><strong>Type mismatch:</strong> Attempting an operation not supported by a particular type</li>
<li><strong>File not found:</strong> Trying to open or read a file that doesn't exist</li>
<li><strong>Null/undefined reference:</strong> Attempting to use an object or variable that hasn't been initialized</li>
<li><strong>Value error:</strong> Data that is invalid for the operation being performed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exception Types</h2>

<p>Different programming languages define different exception types for different kinds of problems. Common categories include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Syntax exceptions:</strong> Errors in the structure of the code (e.g. missing parentheses, incorrect indentation)</li>
<li><strong>Arithmetic exceptions:</strong> Problems with mathematical operations (e.g. dividing by zero)</li>
<li><strong>File/IO exceptions:</strong> Problems reading or writing files (e.g. reading a file that doesn't exist)</li>
<li><strong>Memory exceptions:</strong> Running out of available memory</li>
</ul>

<p>By having specific exception types, a program can clearly communicate what kind of error occurred, making it easier to understand and diagnose problems.</p>
